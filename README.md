# YOLOVM
Implemented YOLOv8m and fine-tuned it on a custom CCTV dataset for detecting violent events and weapons.  Created and managed a high-quality dataset, including accurate annotations for all target objects.  Applied a strong and customized augmentation pipeline (Albumentations) to improve robustness on low-quality and diverse CCTV footage.
